## Teaching_apps

Dashboards and other web applications for teaching. Includes:

 * `casevariation_app`: Illustrates the effects of selecting on the dependent and independent variables and of reducing the number of observations on the results of a study (see also Geddes, Barbara. 1990. "How the cases you choose affect the answers you get: Selection bias in comparative politics" *Political Analysis* 2(1):131â€“50); available on https://idheapunitepolsoc.shinyapps.io/casevariation_app/

 * In `gametheory_apps`:
    * `gametheory_app`: This app lets students play the Prisoner's Dilemma game (single round & repeated) against the computer and the Tragedy of the Commons (in three variants) against each other. It collects the results and stores them in a Googlesheet for later retrieval (Important: Googlesheet and account must be set up first!)
    * `gametheory_app_results`: Retrieves and presents the stored results of students' game theory plays. (Important: Googlesheet and account must be set up first!)
